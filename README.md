This report presents a comparative analysis of several machine learning algorithms applied to
the problem of predicting the quality of Arabica coffee beans based on various features we selected,
including aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, uniformity, clean cup, sweetness, moisture,
Quakers, defects, and altitude.

The dataset used in this study was obtained from the Coffee Quality
Institute (CQI) and contained information on over 1300 coffee samples from different regions around
the world. We used linear regression, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors classification (KNN),
and Random Forest to build models that can accurately classify coffee beans into specialty grade or
non-specialty grade categories. The performance of each model was evaluated using several metrics,
including accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC.
